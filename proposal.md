# X-Team 77 Project Proposal

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

### Briefly describe a problem that your team would like to solve.  
Keep attendance and strike records for 100+ employees. Be able to mark down a variety of reasons for abscences and tardiness such as various emergencies or midterms. Be able to mark a variety of attendance infractions such as no call no show and calling in sick.
Keep the record of the attendance for the last 100 days, and update last 100 based on current date.
Record attendance inquiries and communication details for each employee with the ability to view all inquiries at once.

### Describe at a high level a program that could solve that problem.
The program would have simple GUI with a search bar, the ability to add and remove individuals, and a clickable list of each employee with the most important emplyee information listed next to each employee.  Al categories will be sortable in ascending and descending order and clicking on each individual will bring up more information about them.  Their will also be a second tab that keeps track of communication inquires in a priority queue and presents the one without a response for the longest time as highest priority.

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Give your project proposal a name (and edit the top line of this file)
   X-Team 77 Project Proposal: Project 

2. Output: Describe the output your program will produce.  Include an example format of the output produced.
* Employee Id
* Employee Name
* Number of points per employee
* Number of strikes per employee
* Example: Id - 123456, Name - John Smith, Number of points: 4, Number of strikes - 1

3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.
* Employee name and attendance that corresponds to a point value.
* Example: Employee Name - John Smith, Attendance - N (no show)


4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.
   

5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.
   

Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
