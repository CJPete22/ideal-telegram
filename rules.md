# X-Team 77 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* Conversation
* By strengths and weakness ie the weaker person starts and contacts the stronger if need be. 

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* GitHub
* GitHub is a useful tool to allow us to track progress and make sure everyone is committing everything they need to
* Breif updates through text

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Email and text
* After class discussion if necessary

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* Reaching out early and often if difficulties are encountered.
